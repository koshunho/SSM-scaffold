# SSM-scaffold
The project is built by SpringMVC + Spring + MyBatis and managed project dependencies by Maven.
Compared with springboot's automatic configuration and embedded servlet container. The project is a simple book management system (only the book display, modification, and search functions are implemented). After removing these business logics, it is a pure SSM integration framework.
